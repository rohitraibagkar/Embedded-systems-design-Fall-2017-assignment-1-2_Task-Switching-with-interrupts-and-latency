# Repository for real-time embedded systems design assignment.

This is repository of complete source code to design and implement real-time embedded systems that utilizes interrupts for task switching. Real-time operation is carried out by task scheduling, multi-tasking and implementing state machine.

This operation is summarized below.

## 1)   Scheduling.

This program synchronizes task of flipping LED state to microcontroller clock. Thus flipping the current state of LEDs is scheduled to a particular delay. This program uses `millis()` function from Arduino library. `millis()` returns current value of time elapsed since microcontroller booted in milliseconds.

## 2)   Multitasking.
## 3)   State Machine.
